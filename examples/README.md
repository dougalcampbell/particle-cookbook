# Code Examples

*This folder will contain simple sketches that demonstrate useful snippets.*

## Suggested organization
As we add examples here, create subdirectories named corresponding to the
main topic that links to it, and give each file a reasonably descriptive
name.  If a particular piece of example code will be linked from multiple
topics, do not create multiple example code files -- pick the topic that
seems to be most relevant.  There could be multiple sketches for any given
type of example, so add a two-digit numeric suffix for each file.

For example, if you are adding single piece of sample code which will be
linked both from `powering-projects` and `sleep-modes`, you might create a
file named `examples/sleep-modes/electron-deep-sleep-01.ino`
